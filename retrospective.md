**Difficulties faced**

Joining a group and communicate with the teacher about it. 

The first real difficulty I faced (concerning the actual project) was to think about the use of threads. In this context they 
are the key to everything that is happening. 
The second issue I faced was to keep the list of Readers in the Repository up do date. 


**Lessons learned**

The use of threads in a Server/Clients context. The few that I managed to do made me understand a lot of those aspect seen in class and elsewhere. 
I believe I can now recreate without having too much trouble a similar structure, at least up to the point I managed to reach for this project.

**What's to keep ?**

I genuinely believe that the project proposed this year does a great job at putting into practice what has been taught in class, and informing the students about what exists
while keeping the work amount reasonable. The peer-to-peer aspect is the best way I had to understand why and how to use multithreading and socket connections.   

**What would I do differently ?**

Well for starters, even if I don't find a group, I would start doing the project on my own in case of a similar group issue happening again. Also 
go ahead and tell the teacher about it sooner so that we can reach a solution to it before every group are formed.
